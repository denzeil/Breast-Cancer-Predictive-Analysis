# Cancer Patients Predictive Analysis by Caleb DenzeilÂ¶

> This Dataset contains information about patients that have cancer and whether it's benign or malignant. It also includes the different measurements of tumors for the example radius mean and perimeter. The Dataset has 33 features and 569 rows

> The purpose of this analysis is to predict whether a patient has a malignant tumor or benign using Random Forests.

> The only thing that I changed in the dataset was adding a new column to represent Malignant tumors with 1 and benign 0.

> Their are more patients with benign(357) tumors than  malignant(212).

> Most Patients with benign tumors have a radius mean that ranges within 11-14 while malignant 15-20. While the perimeter mean for benign tumors ranges from 75-90 and malignant 85-140.

> There are patients that have almost the same radius(11-16) and perimeter(80-105) mean but have benign and malignant tumors.
